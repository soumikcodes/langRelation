Language Relationships Application: Discovering Commonalities Across Languages By Alina and Soumik

The Language Relationships Application is an interactive and collaborative tool that visualises connections between different languages. Each user interacts with a digital object (represented as a node) symbolising their language, which is colour and shape coded for visual distinction. As users bring these language nodes closer together, the app visually demonstrates relationships between the languages with a lone. Initially, the app will focus on displaying the mutual descendent language. Future versions of the app will allow users to filter these relationships, such as shared vocabulary, linguistic structure, phonetic similarities, common words or grammatical structures, by choosing from a menu of customizable criteria.
